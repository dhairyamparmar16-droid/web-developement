        Cuneiform is one of the oldest surviving forms of writing. It was used in Mesopotamia to compose a tremendous number of texts on clay tablets, thousands of which survive to the present day. Cuneiform had no paragraphs or even spacing between words with the symbols all written directly adjacent to one another. Egyptian hieroglyphics were also unspaced, but as they wrote on papyrus with ink, Egyptians scribes introduced the practice of rubrication: the scribes used black ink for the main body text and contrasting red ink for headings.
        Greek scribes developed other approaches to organizing text, although the earliest Greek and Latin documents were written in solid blocks of capital letters with little to no spacing, paragraph breaks, or punctuation. Some of the oldest Greek inscriptions were written boustrophedon (literally 'as the ox turns') where the direction of the text's flow and the direction the letters face would switch at the end of each line, as an ox plowing a field would reverse directions. Over time, text direction (left to right) became standardized. Word dividers and punctuation were developed in Hellenistic Alexandria, but were only gradually adopted over centuries. Literature scholars believe that early manuscripts lacking in punctuation and spacing were meant to be read aloud.
        The paragraphos was introduced by scribes in the 4th century AD as a line placed beside a block of text. These marginal symbols evolved into a pair of abbreviations. A stylized K, for kaput/caput or 'head', was placed at the beginning of new sections; a C, for capitulum or 'little head', which evolved into the pilcrow, was placed at the beginning of subsections that modern readers would recognize as paragraphs. In many English manuscripts in the Middle Ages, pilcrows were also placed inline between sentences. Spaces were left at the beginning of paragraphs in early print documents for rubricators to hand-draw the pilcrows. These spaces were eventually left un-rubricated, leading to the modern tradition of indenting a paragraph. Using spacing alone to separate paragraphs eventually became standard.

        A second common modern English style is to use no indenting, but add vertical white space to create "block paragraphs." On a typewriter, a double carriage return produces a blank line for this purpose; professional typesetters (or word processing software) may put in an arbitrary vertical space by adjusting leading. This style is very common in electronic formats, such as on the World Wide Web and email. Wikipedia itself employs this format.

        When referencing a paragraph, typographic symbol U+00A7 § SECTION SIGN (&sect;) may be used: "See § Background".
        In modern usage, paragraph initiation is typically indicated by one or more of a preceding blank line, indentation, an "Initial" ("drop cap") or other indication. Historically, the pilcrow symbol (¶) was used in Latin and western European languages. Other languages have their own marks with similar function.
        Widows and orphans occur when the first line of a paragraph is the last in a column or page, or when the last line of a paragraph is the first line of a new column or page.

        in word processing and desktop publishing, a hard return or paragraph break indicates a new paragraph, to be distinguished from the soft return at the end of a line internal to a paragraph. This distinction allows word wrap to automatically re-flow text as it is edited, without losing paragraph breaks. The software may apply vertical white space or indenting at paragraph breaks, depending on the selected style.
        How such documents are actually stored depends on the file format. For example, HTML uses the <p> tag as a paragraph container. In plaintext files, there are two common formats. The pre-formatted text will have a newline at the end of every physical line, and two newlines at the end of a paragraph, creating a blank line. An alternative is to only put newlines at the end of each paragraph, and leave word wrapping up to the application that displays or processes the text.
